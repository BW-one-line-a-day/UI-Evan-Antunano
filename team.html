      <h3>Back End Architect</h3>
          <p>One Line a Day was built from the ground up with simplicity, ease of use, and efficiency in mind. With One Line a Day you get a straightforward experience without the unnecessary bells and whistles that clutter your screen. Now you can focus on what really matters, your entries.</p>

      <h3>Project Lead</h3>
          <p>Here at One Line a Day we know that sometimes people need to be reminded to make an entry. This is especially true when the goal is to compile entries for years. What people don't need, however, are bothersome and aggressive notifications to get your attention. With One Line a Day, those worries can be set aside. We employ gentle reminders, not guilt trips. Our primary goal is to create a calm and constructive space for you to express yourself. Being pushy goes against our mission statement. </p>
